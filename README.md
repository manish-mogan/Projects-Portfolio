# Projects Portfolio

A recruiter-friendly portfolio of data analytics and data science work using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository layout

- `code/portfolio/` — curated notebooks (complete, story-driven analyses)
- `code/explorations/` — smaller concept notebooks (EDA, visualization techniques, modeling practice)
- `data/` — local datasets used by notebooks

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open any notebook under `code/` in VS Code (or Jupyter) and run cells top-to-bottom.

## Notes

- Some notebooks use live data sources (e.g., OpenStreetMap / Overpass) and require an internet connection.
- Large/visual artifacts (e.g., PDFs) are included when they are part of the portfolio output.
